Task: 
- View the topic with the guideline link(s)
- Skim to get the keywords, use the keywords survey the topic
- From the given link, attempt to cover the project, if the link does not provide the example, try to find similar projects and cover them
- Compile the result (survey, knowledge, ...) that you, your teammate(s), gain from doing the project

Result presented on the report file (MS Word), the format is the same as those of the previous report and named as
SNDPROGSP23PRJxxTSK05.docx (xx must be replaced by your team code - the last two digits on your team code).
Handle in: report file and your src (if any)
The structure of your team's work as follows:
SNDPROGSP23PRJxxTSK05
|------------------SNDPROGSP23PRJxxTSK05.docx
|------------------ src
|                   | --- file1.py

(filename of your team's source code can be any valid ones)
Finally, the folder must be compressed into SNDPROGSP23PRJxxTSK05.zip and only one representative member of the team submits
