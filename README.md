# Sound_Processing
Basic sound processing involves manipulating audio signals to achieve desired effects or modifications. 
Here are some fundamental techniques used in sound processing:

  Sampling: Sound is represented as a series of discrete samples taken at regular intervals. The sampling rate determines the number of samples per second and affects the audio quality.
  Playback and Recording: Sound can be played back or recorded using audio devices such as speakers and microphones. Playback involves converting digital audio data into analog signals,
  while recording converts analog signals into digital data.

  Filtering: Filtering alters the frequency content of a sound by selectively amplifying or attenuating specific frequencies. Common types of filters include low-pass, high-pass, bandpass, and notch filters.

  Equalization (EQ): EQ adjusts the balance of frequencies in a sound. It can boost or cut specific frequency bands to shape the overall tonal characteristics of the audio.

  Dynamics Processing: Dynamics processing techniques include compression, expansion, and limiting. Compression reduces the dynamic range of audio signals, while expansion increases it. Limiting sets an upper limit on the signal level to prevent distortion.

  Time-based Effects: Time-based effects modify the temporal aspects of sound. Examples include reverb (simulating the acoustic characteristics of a space), delay (repeating a sound after a short time), and chorus (creating a thicker sound by duplicating and detuning the original signal).

  Pitch Shifting: Pitch shifting alters the pitch of a sound, either up or down, while maintaining the original duration. It can be used for effects like harmonization or creating artificial voices.

  Noise Reduction: Noise reduction techniques aim to reduce unwanted noise in the audio signal, such as hiss, hum, or background noise. Common methods include spectral subtraction and adaptive filtering.

These are just a few examples of basic sound processing techniques. Sound processing can be a complex and diverse field, with numerous advanced techniques and algorithms available for more specialized applications.
